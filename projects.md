## StuyActivities
<a href="https://StuyActivities.org" target="_blank">StuyActivites</a> is an after-school activity manager actively used by nearly 3500 students and faculty members at Stuyvesant High School, which I helped create in my time as Student Union President and Vice President. It is built in Python 3 using Flask, Amazon S3, PIL, and SQLAlchemy and the front-end is built with WTForms, Jinja, jQuery, and various JS libraries. The application features a club chartering and approval system, meeting and attendance management with personalized and global calendars for students, and a built-in room reservation system. Students can join and create clubs online, can request funding from the Student Union or Parentâ€™s Association for their organizations, and can get information out to their members all from one convenient site.
