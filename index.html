  Hey there! My name is Vishwaa Sofat and I am a recent graduate from Stuyvesant High School and an incoming
  first year at the University of Califonia, Berkeley, where I intend on double majoring in Computer Science
  and Political Science. I hope to apply the skills and knowledge from my degree to address the issue of
  healthcare inequities and grow the work of my non-profit, <a href="https://directhealthaccess.org">
  Direct Health Access</a>.
  <br><br>
  Throughout high school, I have been actively involved in student governmentâ€”most recently in my capacity as
  Student Union President. I have also been a leader within the Model United Nations and Varsity Cricket
  teams. I hope to continue pursuing these passions in college.
  <br><br>
  I have previously worked on Capitol Hill and advised Congressional, local representatives, and the Chancellor
  of the NYC Department of Education. I have also had the opportunity to engage in a mentorship program
  at Google NYC to further my full-stack software development and product management experience.
  <br><br>
  I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2020, particularly in web development and politics. If you
  think I would be a good fit, please <a href="mailto:vishwaa@berkeley.edu"> reach out</a>.
